# Promote a hardware-tested candidate image to a clean release tag (stable + semver).
#
# Rationale: CI only ever emits per-version-candidate tags like
# `server-m<Mesa>-v<llama>-<timestamp>`. The `:stable` / `:vX.Y` release tags are
# NOT produced by any workflow — they live purely as manual promote points. Without
# a recorded procedure, `:stable` can silently drift from what is actually validated.
# This script makes the promote step explicit and auditable (mirrors the SYCL repo's
# promote-b70-image.sh).
#
# When to run: after a candidate image has passed the T1–T5 suite on real B70 / 7900 XTX
# hardware (0 crashes, offload line verified), promote its exact digest to `:stable` and
# a semver tag so production and docs point at a known-good image.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/promote-vulkan-image.sh <candidate-digest> [semver] [repo]
#
# Examples:
#   ./scripts/promote-vulkan-image.sh sha256:4b7923e9... v0.1.0
#     -> tags the digest as both :stable and :v0.1.0 (same image)
#
# Note: tagging is a manifest-only operation (~0.7s). After promoting:
#   1. close the candidate's issue ("promoted to :stable = :vX.Y")
#   2. optionally GC the duplicate per-version tags left behind by redundant builds
