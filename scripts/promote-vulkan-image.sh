# Promote a hardware-tested candidate image to its channel tag, and advance :latest.
#
# Rationale: CI only ever emits per-version-candidate tags like
# `server-dev-m<Mesa>-<llamacpp-ref>-<timestamp>` / `server-m<Mesa>-v<llama>-<timestamp>`.
# The `:stable` / `:server-dev` / `:latest` tags are NOT produced by any workflow —
# they live purely as manual promote points. Without a recorded procedure, an anchor
# can silently drift from what is actually validated. This script makes the promote
# step explicit and auditable (mirrors the SYCL repo's promote-b70-image.sh).
#
# When to run: after a candidate image has passed the suite on real B70 / 7900 XTX
# hardware (0 crashes, offload line verified), promote its exact digest so production
# and docs point at a known-good image.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/promote-vulkan-image.sh <candidate-digest> [semver] [repo] [channel]
#
#   channel: "stable" (default) -> moves :stable  (+ :$SEMVER when given)
#            "dev"              -> moves :server-dev
#
# Examples:
#   ./scripts/promote-vulkan-image.sh sha256:4b7923e9... v0.5.0
#     -> :stable and :v0.5.0
#   ./scripts/promote-vulkan-image.sh sha256:57ded142... "" ghcr.io/OWNER/IMG dev
#     -> :server-dev only  (:stable is NOT touched)
#
# :latest — "last known-good image", whichever channel
#   :latest always tracks the most recently built image that we tested AND promoted,
#   on either channel. It is MONOTONIC by image build date: it only ever moves to a
#   NEWER build, never backwards. Promoting an older digest (e.g. a re-promote of a
#   stable release after a dev build) leaves :latest where it is and says so.
#   Rationale: `docker pull repo:latest` should never hand someone bits older than
#   what they already got. Set LATEST=0 to skip :latest entirely.
#
# Note: tagging is a manifest-only operation (~0.7s). After promoting:
#   1. close the candidate's issue ("promoted to :stable = :vX.Y")
#   2. optionally GC the duplicate per-version tags left behind by redundant builds
